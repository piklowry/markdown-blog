# How to post a new section at CMS like blog?

the main project consist of this

```
blog-content
|-  section-title-1
|   |-  desc.md
|   |-  full.md
|-  section-title-2
|   |-  desc.md
|   |-  full.
|-  section-title-n
|   |-  desc.md
|   |-  full.md
```

in a nutshell all this means the section title of the blog will be the inner blog-content folder-name, <pre>desc.md</pre> is the file
used to show the minified version of the whole content,  <pre>full.md</pre> is the file
used to show the whole content , btw you can include links , images, and all markdown stuff
